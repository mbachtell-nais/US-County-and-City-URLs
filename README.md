# United States Counties with URLs
Python script to pull the URLs of counties, parishes, etc... for the states and territories of the United States states from Wikipedia.  This is driven from the Wikipedia table found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_counties_and_county_equivalents.

The Python script will output a CSV of the county name, the state, and the URL.
